  <p><em>Student of <strong>Full Stack Web Development</strong></em></p>
  <p>I had been studying <strong>Mobile Development</strong> for a little over a year<br />
    when I realized, based on my location, I would be much better off learning <br>
    <strong>Full Stack Web Development</strong>. So I am now learning all there is to learn about <br>
    <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>, <strong>JS</strong> and everything else I can to better my chances of success in this industry.
